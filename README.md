# Financial news filtering and alert generation model.

This repository consists of web extracting code for news articles from google rss, text preprocessing and
and preapration of training data for Custom Named Entity recognition model.


There main models are part of this :-

1) Document clustering
2) NER
3) Word2VEC

# Progress

Data is being collected and stored in mysql database over time, 
Text processing code are being finalised.
Training data for Named Entity recognition model has already been curated.

# Next in Pipeline

Document clustering using Kmeans clustering
Word2Vec for semantic analysis
Improving the overall code structure and making it more robust efficeint
